<span class="blue">The <b>2022 edition</b> of the <b>International Conference on Synthesis, Modeling, Analysis and Simulation Methods, and Applications to Circuit Design</b></span> (SMACD) will be held in Sardinia, Italy. SMACD is a forum devoted to modeling, simulation, and synthesis for Analog,  Mixed-signal, RF (AMS/RF), and multi-domain (MEMs, nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, biological, etc.) integrated circuits and systems. Experiences with modeling, simulation, and synthesis techniques in diverse application areas are also welcomed. Objective technologies include CMOS, beyond CMOS, and More-than-Moore such as MEMs, power devices, sensors, passives, etc.
